# Flow Cube 3D Visualization

This project demonstrates a 3D visualization of a flow cube using React and Three.js. The application renders an interactive 3D cube with numbered walls and a hollow interior, allowing users to visualize and interact with the cube in a web browser.

## Features

- 3D cube visualization with four numbered walls and an open top
- Hollow interior with visible inner surfaces
- Interactive camera controls for orbiting around the cube
- Fixed camera distance to maintain consistent view
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Three.js: A cross-browser JavaScript library used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser
- React Three Fiber: A React renderer for Three.js
- React Three Drei: A collection of useful helpers for React Three Fiber

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

## Usage

The 3D cube will be displayed on the main page. Users can:

- Orbit around the cube by clicking and dragging with the mouse
- View the numbered walls and hollow interior from different angles

The cube is designed to represent a flow visualization, with each wall numbered for reference.

## Customization

The cube's appearance can be customized by modifying the `FlowCube3D.js` component. You can adjust colors, dimensions, and camera settings to suit your specific visualization needs.
